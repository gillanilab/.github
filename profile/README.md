## Welcome to the Gillani Lab! :relaxed:

The Gillani Lab is a computational biology research group led by Dr. Riaz Gillani at the [Dana-Farber / Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center](https://www.danafarberbostonchildrens.org/), [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/), and the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/).

Our group aims to advance **pediatric, adolescent, and young adult cancer care** using *cutting-edge computational biology approaches*. We hope to contribute to a **comprehensive understanding of the germline genetics and tumor genomics of pediatric cancer** to inform **novel approaches to the management of pediatric cancer**.
